Banshee: Bandwidth-efficient DRAM caching with in-package DRAM
via Software/Hardware cooperation

Intel and MIT and ETH Zurich


in-package DRAM is same ish latency but much higher throughput
but most cache designs optimize for hit latency, not bandwidth
so not good for in-package DRAM as cache

Enter Banshee: same latency but higher bandwidth efficency
Eliminate bandwidth overhead by elimniating costly 
tag access through virtual memory
and instead use hardware extension to tlb with tags and tag buffer

Lot of traffic in DRAM with current design goes to meta data management
tags, LRU bits and cache replacement


Previous design PTE/TLB-based DRAM cache has TLB coherency problem
must update TLB each time DRAM cache is modified to keep track of which memory is in DRAM cachce (in package) or out
Forces replacement to happen every cache miss means
low bandwidth efficiency replacement policy

vs. Banshee can use frequency-based replacement.
