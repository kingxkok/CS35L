Week 9 Homework: Managing Change
Ng Xian Kai

1. hi!

2.
$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote
Switched to a new branch 'quote'

3.
$ patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4.
Instructions weren't so clear on the wiki page
on how to use it...
do I emacs a file ?

Turns out I just run emacs in the dir and C-x 4-a

5. 
Referenced git-log.txt for proper formatting of the ChangeLog message

First line is turned into subject in the patch file, so for the patch output
to be properly formatted, we remove the date, name and email line, and the 
tabs of the standard ChangeLog format.

$ cat ChangeLog
maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
`like this' or ``like this''.
* src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
* src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value)
(compare_files):
* src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage)
(read_diff):
* src/dir.c (compare_names):
* src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):
* src/util.c (finish_output):
Quote 'like this' in output.

6.
$ git commit -aF ChangeLog

7.
$ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

smooth sailing :D

8.
sent my formatted-patch.txt to Xilai and he sent his to mine over 
facebook messenger
$ git checkout v3.0 -b partner
$ git am ../formatted-patch.txt
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall17/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
$ patch -p1 < diffutils-gets.diff
use lib/stdio.in.h
$ make
$ make check
Xilai's patch has same make check errors as I did (refer to lab9.txt)
So I'm pretty sure it's ok.
$ ./src/diff --help  | grep '`'
$ ./src/diff . - 2>&1 | grep '`'
$ ./src/sdiff . - 2>&1 | grep '`'
and other tests with diff3 and cmp
output no grave accents
so yay!


9.
$ make distdir
$ cd diffutils-3.0.1-a9d0
his ChangeLog entry is reflected on the ChangeLog file 
(mine works for him too :) )

10.
Installed VcXsrv (from ssh lab)
on my local machine:
$ ssh -X xian@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
$ gitk
scroll thru the box with dates with the bar
to the newest change on the 24th of Jan 2015
Since I'm assuming not newer than
25th Jan means before 00:00 on Jan 25
i.e. Jan 24 23:59 or earlier

did PrtScr pasted to paint and saved
and wrote my observations into ASCII characters
$ brain-describe gitk-screenshot.png >> gitk-description.txt  # haha
