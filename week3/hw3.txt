Q1
No, it's just a label for a removed goto
 so it didn't have to be removed.
But it was removed for readability,
and to avoid useless (and possibly confusing) code.

Q2
We have to watch for compatibility issues:
if a program used ls assuming a certain 
default format that has now changed,
we have to update the program to handle 
the output style of this patch.
Further, in countries where the 
shorthand names of the months
are different, where Oct, May,
or Jun may make no sense,
users could be confused.

Q3
[xian@lnxsrv09 ~/Desktop]$ ./randline.py /dev/null
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))] 
	 # ^raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

Since seq is empty (because it's read from /dev/null which is empty)
seq[0] would also cause index error since an array with nothing
has no 0th (1st) element either.

Q4
[xian@lnxsrv09 ~/Desktop]$ python3 randline.py ~/Desktop/hw3.txt
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This syntax error comes because Python3 removed
automatic tuple unpacking in lambda functions.
We would need to reference each argument in the tuple
by index e.g.
	except IOError as errno_strerror
and later do
	errno_strerror[0] for errno
and
	errno_strerrpr[1] for strerror
